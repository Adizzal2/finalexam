# finalexam
This is the final exam for my Version Control 1 course
I'm a young developer who has big plans to help out small businesses with exposure and more accessablity with their own web pages. I like to refer to myself as a jack of all trades master of none. Also I tend to bite off more then I can chew since the bar was raised so high while younger i always try to do better regardless of my own capabilites.
